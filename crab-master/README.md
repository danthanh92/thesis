# Crab - A Recommendation Engine library for Python

  Crab is a ﬂexible, fast recommender engine for Python that integrates classic information ﬁltering recommendation algorithms in the world of scientiﬁc Python packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib). The engine aims 
  to provide a rich set of components from which you can construct a customized recommender system from a 
  set of algorithms.

## Usage

  For Usage and Instructions checkout the [Crab Wiki](https://github.com/python-recsys/crab/wiki)

## History
  
  The project was started in 2010  by Marcel Caraciolo as a M.S.C related  project, and since then many people interested joined to help in the project.
  It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers, members of the Python-Recsys Labs.

To run the tests you will also need nose >= 0.10.

 
## Install

This package uses distutils, which is the default way of installing
python modules. To install in your home directory, use::

    python setup.py install --home


To install for all users on Unix/Linux::

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

## Testing

After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the
source directory (you will need to have nosetest installed)::

    python -c "import crab; crab.test()"

Or you can test by calling::
    
    make test

See web page http://python-recsys.github.com/install.html#testing
for more information.
